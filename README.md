# Programming for Humanities 
## Final Project

1. Introduction  
This is a project for CDH 598: Programming for Humanities. 
In this project, I attempt to practice my skill of writing python code. 
As will shown, the project has different sections. 
The corpus I will use in this project is provided by the instructors. 

2. **Bibliography** 
I am not familiar with the corpus. Thus, I have to know how many documents my corpus have and the number of them in each year.
I create a bibliography and a bar plot in this part of my project.
